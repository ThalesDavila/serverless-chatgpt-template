## Adapting the Template for Your Specific ChatGPT Plugin Needs

The default configuration provided in the template is not intended to work immediately with ChatGPT. This is because ChatGPT is designed to provide meaningful and contextually relevant responses to user queries, rather than simply returning a "Hello, World!" message.

The template serves as a starting point for developing a plugin that can enhance the capabilities of ChatGPT by integrating with external services or providing additional functionality. As such, it requires customization and configuration to suit the specific needs of the plugin you are developing.

In other words, the default configuration is a scaffold that helps you get started with plugin development. It's up to you to modify and expand it to create a plugin that can interact effectively with ChatGPT and provide the desired functionality.
